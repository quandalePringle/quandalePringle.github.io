        <h2 class="subtitle">What exactly is CRISPR?</h2>
        <p class="bodyTXT">
            CRISPR-Cas9 is short for 
            <em><strong>C</strong>lustered <strong>R</strong>egularly <strong>I</strong>nterspaced <strong>S</strong>hort 
            <strong>P</strong>alindromic <strong>R</strong>epeats and <strong>C</strong>RISPR-<strong>As</strong>sociated 
            Protein <strong>9</strong></em>. It consists of two key molecules that introduce a <strong>mutation</strong> 
            into the DNA. These two changes are:
        </p>
        <ul class="dotPoints">
            <li>An enzyme called <em>Cas9</em> cuts two strands of DNA at a location in the genome so that other parts of 
            DNA can be added or removed.</li>
            <li>A type of RNA called guide RNA (gRNA), which contains a pre-designed RNA sequence, helps guide the Cas9 enzyme 
            to the correct place where the mutation is required.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="bodyTXT">
            The CRISPR-Cas9 system was inspired by some bacteria with a similar gene editing system built in to fight 
            off pathogens and viruses. These bacteria use CRISPR to remove parts of the virus DNA but keep some behind to help them 
            recognise and defend themselves against it next time (yourgenome 2016).
        </p>
        <p class="bodyTXT">
            Although it is the cheapest and most effective method of gene editing available at the time, CRISPR-Cas9 does have 
            its flaws. The sequence in the gRNA consists of 20 bases and matches the target sequence that needs to be edited in 
            the gene. But this doesn't mean that all 20 bases need to be the same to bind.
        </p>
        <p class="bodyTXT">
            For example, 19 out of the 20 bases might be a match for a completely different part of the genome (yourgenome 2016). 
            This would result in a mutation in the wrong part of your genome could have detrimental long-term effects.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Is it Ethical?</h2>
        <p class="bodyTXT">
            The ethical implications of advanced gene editing are the subject of wide debate, due to the possibility of augmented
            humans beyond medical purposes. It is argued that these gene-editing technologies can be used to enhance generations of 
            humans by editing the germline (reproductive) cells, which can mean that some people might quite literally be "built differently". 
        </p>
        <p class="bodyTXT">
            The gene editing that is carried out frequently today is somatic cell editing. Editing somatic cells restrict the effects of the
            mutations on the person it is performed on. However, editing germline cells results in the descendants of the person also retaining
            the effects of the mutation. This means that whole generations can be modified to have, or not have, certain characteristics. It is 
            hard to accurately determine the potential consequences of this type of gene editing and, as a result, it is prohibited in most countries.
            This doesn't exclude it from being subjected to harsh debate, though. The ethics of this practice have been questioned; will CRISPR-Cas9 
            gene editing be allowed for non-medical purposes? This is the main social implication of this gene technology, as it allows for the 
            possibility for parents to have so-called "designer babies" (Bergman 2019).
        </p>
        <p class="bodyTXT">
            A controversial incident of genetically editing germline cells is when Dr He Jiankui used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to alter the DNA of 
            two human embryos. He attempted a mutation that would affect both copies of a gene called <em>CCR5</em>, hoping to make 
            the children resistant to HIV (Greely 2019). Because this was a germline cell, it means that there is a possibility that 
            these mutations will carry on to the future offspring of these two children. Though this may seem like a noble cause, it is the use 
            of gene editing for physical enhancement and not for a medical purpose. HIV/AIDS shaming is a fact of life in China, and this mutation 
            was performed so that these children would be exempt from it (Bergman 2019). This raises the chance of humans being able to "play god" 
            and potentially choose what traits their baby will have.
        </p>
        <p class="bodyTXT">
            Contrarily, it allows for worldwide immunity against preventable, or even currently unpreventable, diseases. If this process could be 
            performed on a larger scale it could result in the eradication of a disease like HIV, or even increase resistance to other diseases eg. 
            COVID-19.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Final Observations</h2>
        <p class="bodyTXT">
            Gene editing is an emerging technology that shows to have a lot of potential in medical and scientific practices. It opens up new 
            pathways for debates and discussions regarding the regulation of its use; should parents be allowed to choose the traits their child has? 
            Or is this practice inhumane and this technology should only be used for extreme medical purposes? These questions will be asked for 
            years to come until the use of this technology becomes part of our daily lives. Until then, we will have to rely on nature to randomise 
            our traits.
