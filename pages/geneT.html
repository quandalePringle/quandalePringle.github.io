        <p class="bodyTXT">
            Gene technology is the use of biotechnology to change an organism's genes.
            Since the discovery of DNA in the 1950s, progress on new discoveries has only increased. The original
            Human Genome Project, which was aimed to find and map all the genes in a human, took 13 years to complete
            and cost $3 billion. This same process can be performed today in just 3 days and costs less than $1000
            (Royal Society 2017). Basic genetic technology already exists today in the form of genetic testing. It can
            be used to diagnose rare conditions or see what genes someone has inherited. Genetic testing detects changes
            (called <strong>mutations</strong>) in a person's genes to determine the likelihood of developing a genetic
            condition, like cancer.
        </p>
        <p class="bodyTXT">
            However, advanced gene-editing technology is more emerging and subject to many ongoing ethical debates. 
            One such example is <strong>CRISPR Cas9</strong>, which is the most efficient, fast and cheapest
            method currently available (MedlinePlus 2020).
